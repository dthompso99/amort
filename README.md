# Amortization Calculator
Simple Wordpres Amortization Calculator

To use, simply activate the plugin, and use the shortcode [amortization_calc] wherever you would like.  I've used minimal styling and basic HTML, so you should be able to adapt to your site.

To override the template, copy "inline_calc.php" from the templates subdirectory to your theme root folder, and customize away.

# Changelog
